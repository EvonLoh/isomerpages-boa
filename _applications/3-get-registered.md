### **General Registration Requirements For Architectural Practice in Singapore** 

The Board of Architects, Singapore (BOA) is the statutory authority established to administer the Architects Act 1991. The Architects Act 1991 sets out the general qualifications and requirements for registration and the BOA is responsible for evaluation of applications for admission to the Register of Architects.

### **Requirements for Registration as an Architect**

The requirements for registration as an architect in Singapore are:
* an approved academic qualification in architecture; and
* an appropriate practical experience in architectural work

In addition the Board must be satisfied that an applicant for registration is a fit and proper person.

### **Academic Qualification in Architecture**

To meet the academic requirement for registration, applicants must possess qualification required under section 15(1) of the Architects Act. Subject to this section, the following persons shall, on payment of the prescribed fee, be entitled to registration under this Act:

* any person holding the degree of Bachelor of Architecture from the National University of Singapore or the University of Singapore;
* any person holding any other degree, diploma or qualification which the Minister may, after consultation with the Board, approve for the purpose of entitling the holder thereof to be registered under this Act;
* any person who satisfies the Board that he is otherwise qualified by having proper and recognised training in architecture and who passes such examinations as may be required by the Board.
