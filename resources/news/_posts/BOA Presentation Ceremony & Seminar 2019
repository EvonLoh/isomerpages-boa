### **BOA Presentation Ceremony & Seminar 2019, 31 Aug 2019, 7.40 AM**

I am pleased to announce that the Board of Architects (BOA) will hold its annual Seminar in conjunction with the 2019 Certificate Presentation Ceremony on 31 Aug 19 (Sat) at 7.40 am at the Grand Ballroom, Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, 392 Havelock Road, Singapore 169663.

The BOA Presentation Ceremony is an annual event where the architectural fraternity gather to witness the conferment of Registration Certificates to our newly registered architects, and to get updates on issues pertinent to the profession and the industry locally and internationally.  

As the Registrar of BOA, I will be updating the architectural fraternity on current issues affecting the industry including  learning points derived from disciplinary cases, illegal practices and issues concerning registration and the code of conduct and professional ethics.

This year we have lined up two prominent architects to speak at the Seminar. One is Mr. Ole Scheeren, a German architect recently registered with the Board who is renowned for his unconventional architecture internationally and is associated with the design of two Singapore projects - the DUO and the Interlace.  The other speaker is Ar. Siew Man Kok, President’s Designer of the Year Award (2015) Winner who is Chairman of award winning firm MKPL Architects Pte Ltd, whose approach to architecture is to integrate nature with architecture.  

In line with our government’s move to recognise and honour our Pioneer and Merdeka Generation, the Board has also invited our pioneer architects to share their contribution in shaping the landscape of Singapore to what she is today – a distinctive global city. This will be an interactive session with the audience and it will be moderated by the Registrar of the Board.  Amongst the pioneers who will share their rich experience are Ar. Sonny Chan Sau Yan of CSYA Pte Ltd, Ar. Goh Peng Thong of AWP Pte Ltd, Ar. Raymond Woo of Raymond Woo and Associates Architects, Ar. Tan Cheng Siong of Archurban Architects Planners Pte Ltd and Ar. Ernesto Bedmar of Ernesto Bedmar Architects Pte Ltd, just to name a few.

More details on the seminar will be published nearer the date 31 Aug 19. 8 CPD points will be awarded to participants.  Response to this annual event has always be overwhelming so we urge you to keep the date free for the seminar and to register immediately once the  announcement for registration is published on the Board’s website.

We look forward to seeing you at the Seminar.
