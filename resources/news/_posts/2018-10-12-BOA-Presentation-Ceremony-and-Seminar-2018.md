To all Registered Architects 

## BOA PRESENTATION CEREMONY AND SEMINAR 2018
27 OCT 2018, 7.40 AM, SUMMIT 1 LEVEL 3
SUNTEC SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION & EXHIBITION CENTRE

I am pleased to announce that the Board of Architects (BOA) will be holding its annual seminar in conjunction with the 2018 Certificate Presentation Ceremony on 27 Oct 2018 (Sat) at 7.40 am at Summit 1, Level 3, Suntec City, 1 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039593. 

The BOA Presentation Ceremony is an annual event where the architectural fraternity gather to witness the conferment of Registration Certificates to our newly registered architects, and to get updates on issues pertinent to the profession and the industry locally and internationally. 

## Key highlights

As the Registrar of BOA, I will be updating the architectural fraternity on current issues affecting the industry including learning points derived from disciplinary cases, illegal practices and issues concerning registration and the code of conduct and professional ethics. 

I will also be moderating the Interactive Panel Discussion with the speakers at the end of the Seminar. With increased complexity in challenges relating to the built environment, architects will need to rethink their current modes of practice. 

We have invited Ar. Warren Liu, Board Member and Director of A D Lab Pte Ltd, to present the Monomer House project, which is a case study illustrating the collaboration across disciplines to form a common vision to achieve a lean and sustainable solution for building design and construction. The project is now exhibited at the National Design Centre.

BCA had launched the Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM). BOA and SIA had studied the impact of the ITM on the architectural industry. Mr Seah Chee Huang, President of SIA together with Ar. Warren Liu will share with you the ITM framework for the architects’ practice for the future economy. 

You will also be hearing the “Voices of the Younger Architects” on how they see the future of architectural profession during the dialogue session. The programme and seminar details are attached.
